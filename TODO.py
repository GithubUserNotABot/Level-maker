# TODO: In the future, color is something I would like to be able to mess with
# -- (a) if you click on an object you will highlight it and you can change the color by doing that
# TODO: Be able to mouse over a block and left click it to drag it
# TODO: Make end levels actually do something
# -- (a) if you collide with an end level it detects if it was loaded or not (the level your in)

# TODO: be able to make free form objects
# -- (a) maybe by making the "inside" of the object full with the least amount of rects as possible with no,
# or at least as little as possible overlap

# todo: maybe ~~~ make checkpoints tbh I don't know how they will feel in the game

# todo: get text input from the screen
